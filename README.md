Predicting the Quality of Red Wine
This project covers some basic concepts of Supervised Machine Learning 
1) Data Preprocessing 
2) Model Training using different Classification Techniques 
3) Accessing Trained Model Performance using accuracy metrics like Precision, Recall, F1 Score and Confusion Matrix
And finally using the above the model is used to determine good quality and bad quality of wine
