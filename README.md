# Predicting-Wine-Quality
**Model summary** <br />
Basic project on the concepts of supervised machine learning. The model involves 1) Data preprocessing 2) Model training using classification algorithms and finding out the optimized classification algorithm 3) Accessing trained model performance using accuracy metrics like precision, recall, f1 Score and confusion matrix 4) Estimating the model performance 


Usages: Basic machine learning libraries
